**Dataset: Heart failure prediction dataset.** Contains data about which features/parameters can be used to detect if the patient is going to have a heart failure or not.

# Intent

Heart failure is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to address the issue of early detection of heart failure in patients. 

With this the project inted to reduce the mortality rate associated with heart failure by enabling timely medical interventions. Furthermore, the outcome of the project can be used to optimize healthcare resource allocation by focusing on high-risk individuals. Both leading to improved patient outcomes and cost savings.

The patients, healtcare providers, and healthcare systems will benefit from the project. Patients from early interventions, potentially avoiding the onset of severe heart failure. Healthcare providers with a valuable tool to aid in risk assessmnet and treatment planning. Finally, hearltcare systems from reduced hospitalization costs and improved resouce allocation.

We are developing this project to bridge the gap in early heart failure detection. Levaragin machine learning and data analysis, the project aim to empower headlthcare professionals with an accurate risk assessment tool that can easily be integrated into their clincal practice.

# Desired outcome

Given that the problem is a medical issue, the consequences of a misdiagnosis are potentially severe. Misclassifying a patient for heart failure could lead to unnecessary stress, treatment, and healthcare costs. On the other hand, failing to identify a patient could result in a missed opportunity for ealry intervention. With this as a background, the soultion must aim for a high level of accuracy.

The success for this project should be measured by:

- **Accuracy of predictions:** The models ability to correctly identify patiants. This means correctly predict patients that would suffer from heart failure and patients that would not suffer. Furthermore, it is important to minimize the numbers of both false positive and false negatives.
- **Predictive power:** It's important that the model could predict heart failure in advanced so the personal has time to respond with propper treatment.
- **Generalization:** The model should preform well on a diverse range of patient, making it more valuable for healthcare systems throughout the globe.
