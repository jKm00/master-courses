**Dataset: Heart failure prediction dataset.** Contains data about which features/parameters can be used to detect if the patient is going to have a heart failure or not.

# Intent

Heart failure is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to address the issue of early detection of heart failure in patients. 

With this the project inted to reduce the mortality rate associated with heart failure by enabling timely medical interventions. Furthermore, the outcome of the project can be used to optimize healthcare resource allocation by focusing on high-risk individuals. Both leading to improved patient outcomes and cost savings.

The patients, healtcare providers, and healthcare systems will benefit from the project. Patients from early interventions, potentially avoiding the onset of severe heart failure. Healthcare providers with a valuable tool to aid in risk assessmnet and treatment planning. Finally, hearltcare systems from reduced hospitalization costs and improved resouce allocation.

We are developing this project to bridge the gap in early heart failure detection. Levaragin machine learning and data analysis, the project aim to empower headlthcare professionals with an accurate risk assessment tool that can easily be integrated into their clincal practice.
