# Lifecycle of a data science project

## Data set

- Company: Aneo
- Problem: Miss match between energy produced and consumed. Company needs to know this.

## CRISP-DM

Definition: Cross-Industry standard process for data mining

- An agile method with almost no overhead and emphasizes adaptive transitions between project phases

## Documentation

1. Write down problem
2. Write down a suggested solution
3. Ask all involved to get quick feedback

## Data analytics

Examining data to answer questions, identify trends, and extract insights.

### Types of data analytics

- **Descriptive:** What's happening in my business?
- **Diagnostic:** Why is it happening?
- **Predictive:** What's likely to happen?
- **Prescriptive:** What do I need to do?

### Data understanding

- _Get dirty with the data_
- Plot data from different "angles"
- Plot different features together

_Helps for the next step when we need to preprocess the data_

#### Dos and Dont's

- Do not economize yet
- Verify the data set
- Investigate what sort of processing has been already applied to "your raw data"
- Understand anomalies and outliers

## Data preparation

1. Select data (with features)
2. Clean data (correct errors, make code consistend, fix missing data)
3. Contruct data (generate derived attributes)
4. Integrate data (merge information from different source)

## Modelling

1. Select modelling techniques
2. Build model (feature selection, opptimization, training/validation)
3. Assess model (test model on seperate set)
