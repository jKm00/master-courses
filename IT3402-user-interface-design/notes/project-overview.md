## Evaluation

- **Assumptions:** Can make our own assumptions, but how to communicate them in the final report
- **Details:** Important to provides enough details in the final report (example; usability testing, how was it structured, who was part of it, what tasks where given, etc...)
- **Data and analysis:** Collect data from users during interviews and testing. Need to analys it and interperate it. Both what the users said and what we interperated it as should be part of the final report.
