# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

A symmetric block cipher that is intended to replace DES.

## Finite Field Arithmetic

- All operations are performed on 8-bit bytes.

### Basic Field Concepts

- **A field:** is a set in which we can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without leaving the set.

## AES Structure

- Plaintext of 128 bits (16 bytes)
- Key length of 16, 24, or 32 bytes (128, 192, or 256 bits)
- Referred to as AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 depending on the key length
