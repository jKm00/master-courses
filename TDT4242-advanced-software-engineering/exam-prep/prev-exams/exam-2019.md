# Exam 2019

## Open-ended Questions

### 1.

- The purpose of forward and backward traceability is to help developers find the root cause of bugs and problems. With forward traceability, developers can look at the documentation and find the exact code that implements the requirements. Backwards traceability is the oposite where developers can look at a code snippet and understand what requirements the code is implementing.
- To achieve forward and backwards traceability, requirements should be documented together with the code that implements the requirements in form of the file and maybe also line numbers. Test should also be implemented and documented specifying which tests are testing which requirements and where to find these tests in the code base.

#### Correct answer

- Purpose
  - Forward tracability
    - Ensure all requirements are implemented
    - Change impact analysis
  - Backward traceabilit
    - Avoid "gold plating"
    - Change impact analysis
    - Defect impact analysis
    - Root cause analysis of defects
- How to
  - Traceability matrix
  - Trace tagging

### 4.

- Run the tests and establish the link between the test and the code executed
- After the code is changed, identify the changed code
- Base on the link between the code and the test, choos only those tests that are related to the changed code and re-run them.

### 5.

- **How standards:** focus on how we should work -> how to work to achieve safety and security
- **What standards:** focus on what shall be achieved

### 6.

Adaptive random test is when you test modules with random inputs. The benefits of this is to discover edge cases that you might not cover using specific input data.

#### Correct answer

Purpose of adaptive test is to generate test cases that are evenly spread over the entire input domain.

### 7.

- Testing is specific (spot check) where single test are testing single modules while code inspection can look at the bigger picture with an understanding of more or the whole code base.
- Testing test for logical errors whilst code inspection can discover things like code smells and bad practises.
- Code inspection can help a team share knowledge and best practises through code review.

#### Other

- Tests
  - Positive:
    - Can be automated
    - Consistently repeat several actions
    - Fast and high volume
  - Negative: Stubs and drivers
- Code inspection
  - Negative: Unreliable
  - Slow and low volume

## Case Studies

### Requirement Engineering

#### Task 1

| ID | RQ1 |
| Description | The autonomous trucks should drive at default speed. |
| Issues | - Ambiguity: What is default speed? |
| Fix | The autonomous trucks should drive at the speed specified by the road signs. |

| ID | RQ2 |
| Description | We hope the autonomous trucks should have three chairs for the drivers. |
| Issues | - Inconsistency: state that autonomous trucks should have chairs for drivers when they are supposed to driver autonomously |
| Fix | The autonomous trucks should have two passenger seats for human supervisors. |

| ID | RQ3 |
| Description | We hope the truck platooning can drive along the route we set in GPS before the journey and follow the human drivers' command to change the route |
| Issues | - Forward referencing: Refers to route setting in GPS before explaining how the GPS integrations works |
| Fix | The trucks should integrate with the GPS system to follow a pre-set route. The system should allow human drivers to input new commands to change the route during the journey |

| ID | RQ 4 |
| Description | We want the truck to drive safely. |
| Issue | Opacity: Not clear what specific safety measures are required. |
| Fix | The trucks should be equpeed with advanced collision avoidance systems, including LIDAR, radar, and cameras, to ensure safe driving by detecting and avoiding obstacles and other vehicles. |

#### Tast 2

The <entity> shall <function> based on <input>

- RQ1: The aotunomous trucks shall drive at the specified speed based on the road signs captured by the camera sensors.
- RQ2: The autonomous trucks shall have to passenger seats for human supervisors
- RQ3:The trucks shall follow a pre-set route based on the integration with the GPS system. The GPS system shall change the route during the journey based on commands given by the human drivers.
- RQ4: The trucks shall detect and avoid obstalce and other vehicles based on input from avoidance systems that includes, LIDAR, radar, and camera sensors.

#### Tast 2 - System test

- Scalability:
  - Description: Evaluates how well a system can handle increased loads, such as higher traffic and larger data volumes.
  - Implementation: Identify metrics, create test that incrementally increase the load, track response time, throughput, and resource utilization, determine the maximum capacity and identify any bottlenecks.
- Stress testing:
  - Description: Evaluates the system's robustness by pushin it beyond its normal operational limits until it fails.
  - Implementation: Determin components to test, create test cases with extreme conditions, apply the extreme load and monitor the system, obsers performance degradation, errors, and recovery mechanisms, identify the system's failure points and resilience.

### Code Refactoring

1. Duplication of code: `get_logging_level()` defined twice
2. Naming convention: `get_settings_helper()` starts with an underscore
3. Everything in one file: Config, global methods and class definitions all in one file
