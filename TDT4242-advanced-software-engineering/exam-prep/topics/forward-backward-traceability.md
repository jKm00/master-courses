# Forward & Backward Traceability

## Forward Traceability

- Make sure all requirements are implemented
- Change impact analysis: If a change in the requirement is change what part of the code is then impacted?

## Backward Traceability

- Ensure that unnecessary test are not implemented. (Gold plating)
- Change impact analysis: If changes are made to the code, does this affect any of the requirements?
- Defect impact analysis: If there is a defect, what part of the requirement/code is relevant to the defect

## How To

- Use traceability matrixes
- These are matrixes that maps requirements to their code implementation and test cases.
- Used to check if the current project requirements are being
