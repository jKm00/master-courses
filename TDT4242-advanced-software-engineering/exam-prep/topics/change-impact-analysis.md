# Change Impact Analysis

- Want to understand stakeholder groups that is gonna be impacted be the change.
- For each of the stakeholder groups, figure out what the impact will be.

For program development, this means to understand what part of the code is gonna be changed, and select a sub-set of tests that you need to rerun after the change. (Only want to run a sub-set to make testing faster.) The sub-set should include all the tests that are testing the part of the code that is changed.
