# What is Model-Driven _Software_ Engineering?

## Motivation

Increase in complexity: functionalilty, API's, libraries, etc... Causes:
- Time and cost increase
- Difficult to ensure correct delivery
- Poor documentation
- And more...

A step above objects (objects in oop) in terms of abstraction. (Closer to the real world problem)

Idea: Models + Transformation = Artifact

## Terminology

- MBE: Model-Based Engineering
- MDE: Model-Driven Enginerring (Part of MBE)
- MDD: Model-Driven Development (Part of MDE)
- MDA: Model-Driven Architecture (Part of MDD)

## What is a model?

Some definitions:
- A representation of something with a specific purpose.
- A simplification of something, so we can view, manipulated and reason about it

### Example:

A globe is a model of the earth. But only for a given purpose! It can answer the distance between two contries. It cannot show the altitude of some specific mountain.
