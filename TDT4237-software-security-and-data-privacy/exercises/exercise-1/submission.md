# Reflection

I started quite early on SWC. I first tried the exercise but found out quickly that I needed some more theory on OWSAP to continue, so I started on the OWASP Top 10 course. It took me multiple sessions before I went back to the exercise. I also had to try two times on the exercise before I managed to get above the 20% threshold.

Another blocker keeping me from going forward was also my knowlegde of Django. So I spent a couple of hours watching some basic Django tutorials on YouTube that helped along the way.

I really enjoyed the part of the OWASP Top 10 course where we were able to try to perform the different attacks on the websites provided in the course.

I also liked that with SWC everything you need is provided in the browser and you don't have to perform a step-by-step setup to get started.

Throughout the exercise, I learned some of the concepts of Django. More importantly, I got a better grasp and understood the difference between the different vulnerabilities. It made me more aware of what to look out for.

SWC helped by providing concrete examples of the different vulnerabilities. It also helped with showcasing how to circumvent and prevent the vulnerabilities.

Currently, when you select a correct answer in the exercise it only tells you that it was correct. I would find it more beneficial if it also told something about why it was correct. I found myself sometimes guessing using process of elimination without fully understanding why the options I chose were correct. An explanation would hopefully make me realize why.
