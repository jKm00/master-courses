# Exam 2012

## Task 1

### A

**Compare XSS and CSRF**

- XSS stands for cross-site scripting and is a technique where an attacker can create and run some javascript in the client for get some crucial information like auth tokens. An attacker can inject scripts via for example input elements or the url. Example:

```js
<img src="a" onerror="alert(hacked)">
```

- CSRF stands for cross site request foregery and is a technique where an attacker utilizes the fact that cookies stored in the browser are automatically appended to any subsequence request of the domain that set the cookie. An exploit would be if an attacker creates a malicious website that has a form sending some data to a valid endpoint. The browser would then automatically append for example the auth cookie making the malicious form data succeed. To prevent this, a CSRF token should be added to any valid forms via for example hidden inputs, then verified when the form data reaches the server endpoint.
