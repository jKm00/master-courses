# Exam 2012

## Task 1

### A - Compare XSS and CSRF

- XSS stands for cross-site scripting and is a technique where an attacker can create and run some javascript in the client for get some crucial information like auth tokens. An attacker can inject scripts via for example input elements or the url. Example:

```js
<img src="a" onerror="alert(hacked)">
```

- CSRF stands for cross site request foregery and is a technique where an attacker utilizes the fact that cookies stored in the browser are automatically appended to any subsequence request of the domain that set the cookie. An exploit would be if an attacker creates a malicious website that has a form sending some data to a valid endpoint. The browser would then automatically append for example the auth cookie making the malicious form data succeed. To prevent this, a CSRF token should be added to any valid forms via for example hidden inputs, then verified when the form data reaches the server endpoint.

### B - Explain the Needham-Schroeder protocol

_Dont think this is relevant anymore_

### C - Compare DAC and MAC

#### DAC

In DAC the owner of a file or program decides who should be able to read, write, and execute it. E.g. Linux

#### MAC

In MAC, the system enforces a security policy by assigning access classes to each object and subject. The access classes is mandated by a central authority. E.g. Military

### D - What is the simple security property

It states that a subject at a given security level cannot read objects from higher levels. (Bell-LaPadula model)

### E - Compare the Biba and Bell-LaPadula policy models - what are the main differences?

Biba is a security policy model focused on integrity, while Bell-LaPadula focuses on confidentiality:

#### The Bell-LaPadula Model

- No read up: A subject cannot read from objects at a higher level _(Simple Security Property)_
- No write down: A subject cannot write to objects at a lower level _(Star Property)_

#### The Biba Model

- No read down: A subject must not read an object at a lower integrity level
- No write up: A subject must not wrtie to any object at a higher level of integrity

### F - List the seven touchpoints of software security, in order of effectiveness

_Dont think this is relevant_

## Task 2 - Code Quiz

### Case 1

The hash function uses `SHA-1` which is deprecated due to high chance of collision. Using this to verify user password can result in an attacker try different password until he finds something that has the same has value as the users actual password.

#### Fix

```java
public byte[] getHash(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
    digiest.reset();
    byte[] input = digest.digest(password.getBytes("UTF-8"));
    return input;
}
```

### Case 2

The credentials for the database connection are stored in plaintext in the source code. Any attacker with access to the source code can use this to connect to the database.

#### Fix

Store credentials in a local `.env` file and import the values.

```java
@Value("DB_USERNAME")
private final String DB_USERNAME
@Value("DB_PASSWORD")
private final String DB_PASSWORD

public final Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    return DriverManager.getConnection(
        "jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbName",
        this.DB_USERNAME, this.DB_PASSWORD
    )
}
```

## Task 3 - E-voting (RMF)

### Business goals

- More votes
- Faster counting

### Business risks

- False voting -> wrong candidate chosen as president
- System too difficult to use -> fewer votes
- Leaked who votes who

### Technical risks
