# BPMN - Gateways

- Represents a gate mechanism which either allows or blocks the flow in a business process
- May split one flow into multiple, or merge discrete flows in one 

## XOR Gate

- A gate where you have to validate something and based on the output, follow the correct path of the process

## AND Gate

- A gate that describes that from that point, some of the task/activities are happening in paralell

## Pool

- A pool containing flow elements is a process pool (white-box) and is labeled with the name of the process
- An empty pool (black-box) represents a business entity or role labeled with names such as: customer, seller, etc

## Lanes

- Divides the process into lanes to describe what part of the business is responsible for the different steps of the process
