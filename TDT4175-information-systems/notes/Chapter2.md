# Information Systems in Organizations

## Why bother?

- Can't just sit stil
- Things change, and businesses needs to adapt
- Easier to monitor productions line

## External Forces

### Porters Five Forces Model

- Never alone, will always be competetors

#### Switching cost

The cost of switching from one vendor to another

##### Example

Apple makes it ease to change to another iphone, however not so easy to change to an android

#### Bargaining power of buyers

- Defines the amount of power the buyers have

#### Bargaining power of suppliers

- Defines the amout of power the suppliers how.
- With power, the suppliers can regulate the marker and the availability of their product

### Innovation

The application of new ideas to the products, process, and activities of a firm, leading to increased value

#### Types of External Innovation

- Product innovation, film -> digital
- Service innovation, taxi -> uber
  
#### Modes of External Innovation

- Improve a product/service your already have (sustain the market you already have)
- Do something completely new, something that does not exist

## Internal Forces

### Examples of Internal Forces

- Increasing cost
- Decreasing revenues (interest of product/service falls)
- Quality issues (problems with the products you sell)
- Lack of qualified staff
- Increasing time to market
- Work processes not fitted
- Staff competence not fitted

### Value Chains

A series of activities that a single organization performs to transform inputs into outputs

### Supply Chains

- Key value chain in a manufacturing organization
- All organizations in a chain needed from raw material to finished product

### Supply Chain Management

The activities required to get the _right product_ into the _right consumers's hands_ in the _right quantity_ at the _right time_ and at the _right cost_

### Supply Chain Integration

Intergration between organization in a supply chain

### Lewin's Change Model

1. **Unfreezing:** preparing for change
2. **Moving:** making the change
3. **Refreezing:** institutionalizing

### Organizational Culture and Changes

- **Culture:** a set of major understandings and assumptions shared by a group
- **Organizational culture:** the major understandings and assumptions for a business, corporation, or other organization
- **Organizationl change:** how organizations plan for, implement, and handle change

_Employees can be sceptical of new systems. Maybe because they feel like it will negatively impact their workflow_

## Implementation

### Three faces

#### 1. Preparation

- Standardization or localization
- User participantion
- Effects specificstion; What do your want to achieve
- Training; Train employees to use the new system
- Pilot implementation

#### 2. Going live

- Big band or incremental implementation
- Migrate data from old to new system

#### 3. Continuing design during use

- Design before use or design in use?
- Following up on effects realization
- Workarounds
- Continual support for implementation activities

## Key Concepts

### Why IS in organization

Its a way to adapt to changes as a result of external and internal forces

### Adapting by innovating

Can innovate product, services and processes

### Change Managemnet

- Radical: Change product, re-engineering
- Continuous improvments

### Implementation and IS success

Success can be multiple different things. Not one thing to look for
