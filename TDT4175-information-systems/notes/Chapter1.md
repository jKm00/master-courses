# An Introduction to Information Systems

## What is an information system?

A system that helps share information

**Example:** Blackboard

## Data, Information, Knowledge

- Data is just raw facts (does not give much sense alone)
- Information is collection of data organized such that they have a value beyond the facts
- Knowledge is awareness and understanding of a set of information

_Each build on each other_

### Challenges

Today we collect more data then we are able to make sense of

### Example 1

- Data: 125
- Info: 125 kg
- More info: Lecturer is 125 kg
- More info: Lecturer is 1.89 m
- Even more info: Lecturer weight combined with height can give BMI = 35.01
- Know: BMI > 30 -> should loose weight

## The Characteristics of Valuable Information

- Relevant for the situation (If lecturer says their height, for us the students its irrelevent, but for his doctor it is relevant)
- Up to date
- Accessible
- Accurate
- Complete
  
_More available in table of lecture slides (with descriptions)_

## Different Types of IS

- Personal: for personal use
- Group: For sharing information in groups
- Enterprise/business: For improving and change an organzation (main focus of this subject)

### Business IS

- Used in all functional areas of a business organization
- Used in nearly every industry. Not only office work, but also agriculture and more
